                  The Wishlist app comes with two key features, available as
                  extensions to help you add wishlist functionality to your
                  store with ease. Follow the steps below to set it up:

                <Text variant="bodyMd" as="p">
                  Use the <strong>Wishlist Button</strong> extension to add a
                  wishlist button anywhere in your store, whether it's on
                  product pages, collection pages, or even in promotional
                  banners. Simply drag and drop the button where needed. When a
                  customer clicks the button, the product is added to their
                  wishlist, which is stored locally on their device using{" "}
                  <strong>local storage</strong>. This allows users to maintain
                  their wishlist even if they leave the site and return later.

                <Text variant="bodyMd" as="p">
                  The <strong>Wishlist Page</strong> extension allows you to
                  create a dedicated page that displays all products added to
                  the customer's wishlist. This page dynamically retrieves data
                  from local storage to show the wishlist items, making it
                  easily accessible for customers to view or modify their saved
                  products.

                  Local Storage for Data Handling
                </Text>
                <Text variant="bodyMd" as="p">
                  We use <strong>local storage</strong> to store and manage the
                  wishlist data. Local storage allows for a quick and seamless
                  user experience, as customers' wishlisted items are stored
                  directly on their device. This ensures that users' wishlist
                  persists even if they refresh the page, close the browser, or
                  revisit the site after some time.
                </Text>

                <Text variant="bodyMd" as="p">
                  The app will automatically retrieve the wishlist data from
                  local storage and display it on the Wishlist Page whenever the
                  customer visits it. This approach eliminates the need for
                  additional backend server calls, making the experience faster
                  and more reliable.
